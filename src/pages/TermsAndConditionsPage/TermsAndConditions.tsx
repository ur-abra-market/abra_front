            attempt by you to assign or transfer your rights or obligations under these
            Terms without such consent will be null and void. We may assign or transfer
            our rights and obligations under these Terms at our sole discretion, without
            restriction. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will bind and insure to the
            benefit of the parties, their successors, and permitted assigns.

            God, war, terrorism, civil unrest, labor disputes, natural disasters,
            epidemics, pandemics, failure of communication systems, or any governmental
            action, provided that such party gives prompt written notice of such cause to

            ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, limitations of
            liability, and dispute resolution provisions, shall continue in full force and

          <p className={style.text}>
            In the event of any conflict between these Terms and any other document that
            is incorporated by reference herein, these Terms shall control. If any
            provision of these Terms is held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in
            any respect under any applicable law or rule in any jurisdiction, such
            invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability shall not affect the validity,
            legality, or enforceability of any other provision or any other jurisdiction,
            and these Terms shall be reformed, construed, and enforced in such
            jurisdiction as if such provision had never been contained herein.

          <p className={style.text}>
            Except as expressly provided in these Terms, there are no third-party

            have no legal or other effect.

          <div className={style.title_block}>55. No Agency</div>
          <p className={style.text}>
            No agency, partnership, joint venture, employee-employer, or
            franchisor-franchisee relationship is intended or created by these Terms.
            Neither party has the authority to bind the other or to incur any obligation
            on its behalf.

          <div className={style.title_block}>57. Equitable Relief</div>
          <p className={style.text}>
            You acknowledge and agree that a breach or threatened breach by you of any of
            your obligations under these Terms would cause us irreparable harm for which
            monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy, and that, in the event of
            such breach or threatened breach, we shall be entitled to seek injunctive or
            other equitable relief as an appropriate and adequate remedy for such breach
            or threatened breach, without the necessity of posting a bond or other
            security.
          </p>
          <div className={style.title_block}>58. Severability</div>
          <p className={style.text}>
            If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a
            court of competent jurisdiction, that provision will be deemed severable from
            these Terms and will not affect the validity and enforceability of the
            remaining provisions. The parties agree to negotiate in good faith a valid,
            {/* eslint-disable-next-line react/no-unescaped-entities */}
            enforceable substitute provision that most nearly affects the parties' intent
            in entering into these Terms.

          <div className={style.title_block}>59. No Waiver</div>
          <p className={style.text}>
            Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be
            considered a waiver of those rights or provisions. The waiver of any such
            right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly
            authorized representative of [Company Name]. Except as expressly set forth in
            these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these
            Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or
            otherwise.
